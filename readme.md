## AdmitKard Tech Hiring Assignment Sept 2023 - Shivam Bhatnagar.

### Greetings!


I am [Shivam Bhatnagar](https://www.bitnagar.dev), a CSE fresher from Noida, graduated last month from IPU. I have attempted the AdmitKard's Tech Hiring Assignment Sept 2023.

I have built exercise/problem statement 2: OTP verification.

I have built both the preferred mock api for OTP verification and optional real SMS OTP verification using Firebase.

## Please note
Firebase OTP auth app has been given separate routes. You can access it on the following routes:

```bash
localhost:3000/firebase -> home page
localhost:3000/firebase/dashboard -> final screen.
```

Mock API routes does not have firebase segment route. You can normally access them at the start of the application.

```bash
localhost:3000/  -> home page
localhost:3000/dashboard  -> final screen
```

No middleware has been used. No routes are protected.



## Installation

Clone the repo in your desired folder.

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/Bitnagar/AK-hiring-challenge-shivam-bhatnagar-sept-23.git"
```

Then `cd` into the project folder
```bash
cd AK-hiring-challenge-shivam-bhatnagar-sept-23
```
